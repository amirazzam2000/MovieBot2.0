          To customize the recommendations I need to know more about your movie taste.
          Can I ask you a few questions? It will take a couple minutes.

      Great!
      This test is very simple. Just give me the name of 3 movies you like.
      If they are from different gender the more customized the recommendations will be.
      Let's get started with the first one.
      Tell me the name of a movie you like.

    - text: We're almost done... one more movie please.
